# Content Management Website

This was a website I made as part of my BTEC Level 3 Computing course.

It allowed for uploading, viewing, modifying, and deleting of markdown files within a web-based interface.
Additionally, it also allowed for the highest ranked Users ('Admins') to be able to create, edit, and delete Users stored onto the system.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL SCRIPTS FOR UPLOADING OF FILES HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR SECURITY REASONS**

If you would like to see these scripts that have been removed, feel free to ping me a DM or something on Twitter (@TwilightZebby)[https://twitter.com/TwilightZebby]
